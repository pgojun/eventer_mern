# MERN Stack Event Listing and Managing Application - Eventer v1.0
Live version: https://eventer-pgojun.netlify.app/
## About

This is a side project that I built using MongoDB, Express, React and Node.
The purpose of the application is to mimic an event advertisement platform.

I plan to add more features to the application in the future.

## Functionalities

Guest users can:
1. Browse the events on the events page and filter them through the search bar
2. View each event separately on the event details screen
3. Go to Login or Signup pages and log in or register to use all of the features of the application

Registered users can:
1. Browse the events on the events page and filter them through the search bar
2. View each event separately on the event details screen
3. Star or unstar all of the events
4. Create new events of their own
5. Edit the events that they have created
6. Delete the events that they have created

## Server instalation
0. Make sure you have Node installed on your machine, to downlad go to https://nodejs.org/
1. Open Command Prompt / Terminal window in the server directory
2. Run "npm install" to install the necessary packages
3. Recreate the real ".env" file using the ".env.example" that is in the server directory
(in order for the backend to fully work you have to create your own MongoDB Atlas cluster and set it up in the CONNECTION_URL in the .env file)
4. When done run "npm start"

## Client installation
0. Make sure you have Node installed on your machine, to downlad go to https://nodejs.org/
